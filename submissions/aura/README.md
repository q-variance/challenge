Description

We model log-prices via a gated semimartingale: outside repricing the process follows a càdlàg semimartingale $U$, while during predictable repricing windows the underlying is 
switched off and the log-price evolves by a finite-variation execution path. 
For a single repricing event executed at constant rate and observed in two steps, realized variance satisfies $RV=\tfrac12 R^2$, implying $\widehat V=RV/T=\tfrac12 z^2$ and 
hence a quadratic $q$-variance coefficient $q=0.5$. 
Equal splitting (and thus $q=0.5$) may also arise from trading-time / time-zone or calendar timestamping, and should therefore be assessed separately from true execution mechanics.
