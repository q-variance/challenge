Usual geometric lognormal Brownian motion, drift 4% p/a, base volatility 20%, with geometric lognormal Poisson jumps, 2% (independent) probability per day, 10% jump standard deviation.
 
Each of the 10,000 data points are the log-return and annualized stdev (vol) over a 20-day (approx. one-month) window, so equivalent to simulating over 10,000 months.
